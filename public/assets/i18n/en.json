    "INTRO": "Hey, I’m Lucas. My journey into tech didn’t start in computer science. It started in business. During my BWL degree, I became fascinated by how technology drives modern companies. That curiosity quickly turned into a decision: I didn’t just want to understand digital products — I wanted to build them. Today, I’m fully committed to becoming a developer and continuously improving my skills every single day.",
    "LEARNING": "I strongly believe in the 1% better every day mindset. Software development perfectly reflects that philosophy: refining systems, optimizing codebases, and constantly learning new technologies in a fast-moving industry.",
    "APPROACH": "I love staying curious, exploring new technologies and pushing myself outside my comfort zone. For me, growth is not optional — it’s the baseline.",
    "LOCATION": "I’m based in Leipzig, Germany and open to remote work."
